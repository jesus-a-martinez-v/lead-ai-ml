Before you settle in and get comfortable, we would like to make you aware of our Guest Guidelines & House Rules. Understanding and complying with these will make for a comfortable, safe, and enjoyable stay for everybody:\\n\\nCleanliness - You are required to maintain a good level of cleanliness throughout your stay. In case of any accidental damage, please notify us immediately so that we can assess any damage and repairs if needed. Failure to notify Cortado staff may lead to increases cleaning costs at the end of your stay;\\n\\nDishwasher - Please remember to never use liquid dish soap in the dishwasher. Only use dishwasher detergent or dishwasher pods and rinse all dishes prior to placing them in the dishwasher for cleaning;\\n\\nCookware & Stovetop - To avoid damaging nonstick cookware and stovetops, do not use any sharp, metal, or hard utensils on the cookware and stove top;\\n\\nNo Smoking - We do not allow smoking of any kind (including vaping & e-cigarettes) in the home, anywhere on the property (including on balconies), or anywhere within 50 feet of the property; breaking this rule is grounds for termination of your stay and will incur a $500 cleaning fee;\\n\\nPets - Please message us beforehand if you\'d like to bring your furry friends! We can typically accommodate a single small dog or cat for an additional $50 cleaning fee. Bringing a pet without paying the additional pet fee is a violation of this policy and will result in additional cleaning fees.\\n\\nParties & Excessive Noise - To ensure the safety and wellbeing of all building residents, all parties, events, and excessive noise are prohibited;\\n\\nZero Tolerance - Please ensure that you respect all members of our staff and the home\'s neighbors. Cortado accommodations are a safe and friendly environment where everybody should be treated with the same level of respect.
